During my phone call with Mr. Matthew Mitsui, we primarily discussed his retirement planning and the rollover of his US Pension Plan into an IRA account. Mr. Mitsui informed me that Pearson & Spector, his former employer, was terminating his pension plan, and he wanted to ensure a smooth transition of his retirement assets.

I assured Mr. Mitsui that our institution specializes in wealth management and retirement planning, and we could assist him with the rollover. I began by asking him about his desired strategy for these funds. He mentioned that he wanted to initially place the cash, which amounted to about 15.4 million dollars, into his brokerage IRA. Then, he planned to gradually move it into a managed account with Citi.

In response, I explained to Mr. Mitsui that our institution offers a variety of investment options, including the MACS Core Active/Passive Blender IRA account. This account blends active and passive investment strategies to optimize portfolio performance and risk management. I assured him that we could initiate the rollover process and work closely with him to ensure a seamless transition.

Mr. Mitsui was interested in this strategy and requested more information about the timeline and process. I informed him that once we had the necessary paperwork completed, we would start by transferring the cash from his US Pension Plan into his brokerage IRA account. We would coordinate with Pearson & Spector to facilitate a smooth transfer. Once the cash was in his brokerage account, we would gradually move the money based on a dollar cost averaging strategy, which would enhance long-term returns.

Satisfied with the plan, Mr. Mitsui expressed his desire to proceed with the rollover and implementation of this strategy. However, before moving forward, I wanted to ensure that he understood the implications of an ERISA rollover to an IRA. I explained that based on our cost analysis, a rollover to the Citi MACS account could be more expensive, but an IRA would provide the added protection of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. Mr. Mitsui affirmed his decision to proceed with the rollover despite the potential costs.

Upon confirming his decision, I assured Mr. Mitsui that we could initiate the process immediately. I informed him that my team would prepare the necessary documents and work with Pearson & Spector to expedite the transfer. I promised to keep him informed at every step of the way, providing him with a smooth and transparent experience.

Mr. Mitsui expressed his gratitude for my assistance, and I assured him that it was our pleasure to serve him and guide him through this process. With the phone call concluded, I now have the responsibility of ensuring a seamless rollover and implementation of Mr. Mitsui's retirement strategy, working diligently to protect and grow his assets as he prepares for a comfortable retirement.

PB: Good morning, Mr. Weisburg. Thank you for coming in today. I understand you're preparing to retire from Shearman & Sterling, and you've requested to roll over your US Pension Plan from Shearman & Sterling to a MACS Core Active/Passive Blender 3 IRA account. Is that correct?

HW: Good morning, Ms. [Private Banker's Last Name]. Yes, that's correct. Shearman & Sterling is terminating the pension plan, and I want to ensure a smooth transition of my retirement assets into a suitable account.

PB: I completely understand, Mr. Weisburg. We specialize in wealth management and retirement planning, and we can certainly assist you with this rollover. Before we proceed, could you provide me with some additional details regarding your desired strategy for these funds?

HW: Of course. I would like to place the cash, which amounts to approximately $1.54 million, into my brokerage IRA initially. Then, I would like to gradually move it into my MACS Core Active/Passive Blender 3 IRA account using a dollar cost averaging approach. This strategy has been successful with my other three ERISA rollovers.

PB: Thank you for sharing your strategy, Mr. Weisburg. We can implement your desired approach seamlessly. Our institution offers a wide range of investment options, including the MACS Core Active/Passive Blender 3 IRA account. This account blends active and passive investment strategies to optimize your portfolio's performance and risk management. We can initiate the rollover process and work closely with you to ensure a smooth transition.

HW: That sounds like an excellent fit for my retirement needs. I appreciate your expertise in managing these rollovers. Could you walk me through the timeline and process for implementing this strategy?

PB: Certainly, Mr. Weisburg. Once we have the necessary paperwork completed, we'll begin by transferring the cash from your US Pension Plan into your brokerage IRA account. We'll coordinate with Shearman & Sterling to ensure a seamless transfer. Once the cash is in your brokerage IRA, we'll gradually move it into your MACS Core Active/Passive Blender 3 IRA account, following your dollar cost averaging strategy. This approach will help mitigate market volatility and potentially enhance long-term returns.

HW: That sounds like a well-thought-out plan. I appreciate the cautious approach. I'd like to proceed with the rollover and implementation of this strategy. How soon can we initiate the process?

PB: I'm glad you're satisfied with the plan, Mr. Weisburg. We can begin the rollover process immediately. I'll have my team prepare the necessary documents, and we'll coordinate with Shearman & Sterling to expedite the transfer. We'll keep you informed every step of the way and provide regular updates on the progress.

HW: Excellent. I appreciate your promptness and commitment to keeping me informed. I feel confident that I've made the right choice by entrusting my retirement assets to your institution. Thank you for your assistance.

PB: You're most welcome, Mr. Weisburg. It's our pleasure to serve you and guide you through this important transition. We value your trust and look forward to helping you achieve your retirement goals. We'll be in touch shortly with the necessary paperwork and updates on the progress of the rollover.

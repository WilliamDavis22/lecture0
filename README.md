##### Intro:

In this small project, I build a Sudoku solving application in Streamlit. We
train a computer vision model to recognize numbers in the 9x9 grid and use a backtracking algorithm to solve the actual puzzle.


##### How to Run
```
bash run_app.sh
```

##### Digit Detection

To solve the sudoku puzzle we need to build a digit detector model and then a digit recognizer
model. The detection model will tell us where a digit appears in the image and
the recognition model will tell us which digit it is. We will also generate a dataset for
both models.

#### Detection Model

The detector model is a fully convolutional neural network which outputs a binary mask 
predicting whether or not a pixel is apart of a digit.

#### Recognition Model

The recognition model is a convolutional neural network which has a fully connected output layer
with softmax activation predicting the probability of pixels belonging to each digit. 

#### Data-set

I generated a synthetic dataset to train the detection and recogntion models 
since it does not cost much and hope it works üòâ.

To have a realistic data-set we use multiple types of fonts, sizes, background
colors, grid elements ‚Ä¶

Since we generate those examples from scratch, we can get all the details about
the position and the class of each digit in the image.

### Backtracking

We will use backtracking to solve the Sudoku. This method allows us to
step-by-step build candidate solutions in a tree-like shape and then prune this
tree if we find out that a sub-tree cannot yield a feasible solution.

The way we will do it in the case of Sudoku is as follows :

* For each cell, we compute the possible values that can be used to fill it given
the state of the grid. We can do this very easily by elimination.
* We sort the cells by their number of possible values, from lowest to greatest.
* We go through the first unfilled cell and assign it one of its possible values,
then to the next one and so on ‚Ä¶
* if we end up we a feasible solution we return it, else we go back to the last
cell we assigned a value to and change its state to another possible value.
Kinda like depth-first tree search.

If after exploring all the possible leaves of this tree we can‚Äôt find a solution
then this Sudoku is unsolvable.

The advantage of backtracking is that it is guaranteed to find a solution or
prove that one does not exist. The issue is, while it is generally fast in 9x9
Sudoku grids, its time complexity in the general case is horrendous.

Implementation ( Some operations, like sorting, are performed in the ‚ÄúBoard‚Äù
class):

    def backtracking_solve(board):
        # Modified from 
        set_initially_available(board.cells)
        to_be_filled = board.get_unused_cells()
        index = 0
        n_iter = 0
        while -1 < index < len(to_be_filled):
            current = to_be_filled[index]
            flag = False
            possible_values = board.get_possibles(current)
            my_range = range(current.value + 1, 10)
            for x in my_range:
                if x in possible_values:
                    n_iter += 1
                    current.value = x
                    flag = True
                    break
            if not flag:
                current.value = 0
                index -= 1
            else:
                index += 1
        if len(to_be_filled) == 0:
            return n_iter, False
        else:
            return n_iter, index == len(to_be_filled)

### The App

We build the app using Streamlit. The app needs to allow us to upload an image,
solve the Sudoku, and display the results.

#### File Upload :

Streamlit provides a simple way to create a file upload widget using
st.file_uploader.

    file = st.file_uploader("Upload Sudoku image", type=["jpg", "png"])

#### OCR :

We apply the detector and recognizer model to create the grid.

    grid = img_to_grid(img, detector_model, recognizer_model, plot_path=None, print_result=False)

#### Solving :

We use backtracking to solve the Sudoku.

    n_iter, _ = backtracking_solve(to_solve_board)

#### Display the results :

We Display the results in a nice looking Html/Css table by specifying
unsafe_allow_html=True.

    html_board.markdown("<center>" + to_solve_board.html() + "</center>", unsafe_allow_html=True)

#### Final result :
